    "# The `Dataset` Class\n",

    "The user tools represent all these files with the {obj}`dkist.Dataset` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Dataset` class is constructed from the ASDF file for that dataset, this ASDF file contains the following information:\n",
    "* A table containing all the headers from all FITS files that comprise the dataset.\n",
    "* A copy of the Data Center's inventory record for the dataset.\n",
    "* A `gwcs` object which provides coordinate information for the whole dataset.\n",
    "* A list of all the component FITS files and the required order to combine them into a single array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a `Dataset` object is created from just the ASDF file, without access to the arrays in the FITS files then all the data will be missing, but everything else will function the same.\n",

    "* **World** coordinates are the physical coordinates that correspond to pixel coordinates. These are not always in either pixel or array order, but tend to be close to pixel order.\n",
