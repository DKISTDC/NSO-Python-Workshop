    "# Searching for DKIST Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will cover how to search for DKIST datasets available at the DKIST Data Center.\n",
    "In DKIST data parlance, a \"dataset\" is the smallest unit of data that is searchable from the data centre, and represents a single observation from a single instrument at a single pass band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset comprises a number of different files:\n",
    "  * An ASDF file containing all the metadata, and no data.\n",
    "  * A quality report PDF.\n",
    "  * An mp4 preview movie.\n",
    "  * A (large) number of FITS files, each containing a \"calibrated exposure\".\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these files apart from the FITS files containing the data can be downloaded irrespective of embargo status.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these \"datasets\" the DKIST Data Center keeps a \"dataset inventory record\" which is a limited set of metadata about the dataset on which you can search, either through the portal or the `dkist` Python package.\n",
    "The ASDF, quality report and preview movie can all be downloaded without authenticating, the FITS files require the use of Globus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `Fido.search`\n",
    "\n",
    "The search interface used for searching the dataset holding at the DKIST data center is {obj}`sunpy.net.Fido`.\n",
    "With `Fido` you can search for datasets and download their corresponding ASDF files.\n",
    "To register the DKIST search with `Fido` we must also import `dkist.net`."
