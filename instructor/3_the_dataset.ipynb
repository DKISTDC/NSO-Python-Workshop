    "# The `dkist.Dataset`\n",
    "\n",
    "In DKIST data parlance, a \"dataset\" is the smallest unit of data that is searchable from the data centre, and represents a single self-contained observation [check with Stu for a better short definition here].\n",
    "The user tools represent this unit of data with the `Dataset` class.\n",
    "Within this class the data are stored as many FITS files, each containing a single frame of the observation, and an ASDF file describing how the frames relate to each other.\n",
    "For VTF data, for example, one FITS file would contain a single narrowband image in one Stokes profile at a single time.\n",
    "Since there will be very many of these files, each with their own FITS header, manually tracking and inspecting them would be unmanageable.\n",
    "The `Dataset` class combines these many files into one object, allowing you to inspect the properties and combined headers of the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to construct a `Dataset` object.\n",
    "For the first we will need the ASDF file for the dataset, which we can get using `Fido` as we saw yesterday."
