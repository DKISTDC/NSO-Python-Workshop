    "# Astropy and SunPy - A Quick Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we progress to searching for DKIST data we need to cover some functionality of the [SunPy](https://sunpy.org) and [Astropy](https://astropy.org) packages.\n",
    "These two packages, amongst a few others, are the core components of the DKIST tools.\n",
    "In this session we shall only quickly cover the functionality of SunPy and Astropy we need for the rest of the workshop.\n",
    "There are many other parts of these packages which are useful when working with DKIST data, which you should explore.\n",
    "As we covered in the introduction, Python is a modular language; Astropy provides fundamental functionality for a lot of different types of astronomy.\n",
    "In this section we shall cover the following parts of Astropy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Units\n",
    "* World Coordinate Systems\n",
    "* Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Astropy provides a subpackage {obj}`astropy.units` which provides tools for associating physical units with numbers and arrays.\n",
    "This lets you do mathematical operations on these arrays while propagating the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we import `astropy.units` because we are going to be using this a lot, we import it as `u`."
